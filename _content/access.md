Below you will find venue-specific information on accessing our venues. We strive to offer performance for all and as such have put in a number of facilities to ensure all people can enjoy our shows regardless of specific needs. However we are very aware that we wonâ€™t always get it right and welcome your feedback and suggestions - please email <info@zoovenues.co.uk> to do so.

We have a number of shows offering BSL, Audio Description, Captioned and Relaxed performances. You can find these either by looking at each show in turn or browsing for shows that offer these options [on the programme](/programme/).

For specific information or to chat to us about your visit please call 0131 356 0646 or email info@zoovenues.co.uk.

We strongly encourage pre-purchasing tickets from the booking page or EdFest.com ahead of your arrival at ZOO. In line with the Fringe Society's move to e-tickets, we are not operating paper tickets this year. By pre-booking, you will help speed up waiting and admission times once the doors are open. Doors typically open 5 minutes before the advertised start time.

Assistance Dogs are always welcome in our venues and performance spaces. 

Personal Assistant complimentary tickets are available and can be booked both online and in-person at the box office.
