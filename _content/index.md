<h2 class="display-2"> H﻿ome to the unexpected </h2>

<p>This year we are working with leading VI theatre company Extant to ensure all of our programme is accessible to visually impaired audiences in some way. This will take place in a variety of ways ranging from self-descriptions by performers at the top of shows to fully enhanced performances supported by Extant. Please see individual show pages for details.</p>
