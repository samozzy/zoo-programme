    copy_long: Alone in his miserable bedsit in a busy, bustling metropolis, Dante’s
      only companion is a house robot named She-bot. His girlfriend has left for
      Japan to disconnect from technology and live an older, simpler way of
      being. Dante is lost. Trapped in an unfulfilling job he hates, he embraces
      escapism by writing a film. As the screenplay emerges, we join a Spanish
      knight on a quest alongside his French squire, battling monsters and
      travelling epic landscapes. Gradually, Dante’s worlds begin to merge,
      overlap and intertwine around him.

      through complex costume changes, confrontations, and quirky actor demands,
      all while staying hidden in the shadows. When the stress of invisibility
      gets heavy, supportive allies rally and equip her to stand up, curse like
      a sailor, and be seen. This may be a solo show, but Kimberly Prentice
      quick-changes her way through thirty plus distinct characters as we follow
      Pam’s hilarious, and sometimes harrowing, journey of working in the dark,
      unseen, while trying not to disappear.

    copy_long: Inspired by encounters with people on the margins of society; a
      dissection of trauma and revival, pain and transformation. In a devotional
      setting of sinister rituals and acts of liberation, Madonna and Jesus
      appear as trash prophets. Surrounded by Paradise-Lost-iconography they
      deliver prayers for the outcasts and blessings for queer bodies. After
      their 2018 success with Baby Paradise, provocative German bambule.babys is
      returning to the Fringe with its new production. Alluding to feminist
      philosophy and politics of care, this is a piece dedicated to all those
      homesick for a better world.

    copy_long: From Frankenstein to The Invisible Man, James Whale directed some of
      the greatest movies of all time. How did a working-class boy from Dudley
      end up in Hollywood? An expressionist and out gay man working in the
      studio system at the peak of Hollywood’s golden age, his moment in the
      movie-land spotlight lasted little more than 10 years. Just who was James
      Whale? This one-person show shines a light on his life and work, examining
      a sense of otherness and the outsider, and how his films still resonate,
      90 years on.

      "I got very little, little to no media training, so... Sorry!"
       
       Sir Galahad the Pure, Knight of the Round Table, son of Lancelot the Brave, is taking a bath. Even the chosen one needs a break sometimes, okay? But long soaks in the bath can lead to painful questions, and the cleaner Galahad gets, the dirtier he becomes. In this darkly comedic show about sex, jobs, and the Holy Grail, by the time Galahad gets out, he might not want to be so Pure anymore.

      Carpentry and circus collide.
       In Sawdust Symphony Michael Zandl, David Eisele and Kolja Huneck combine their passion for crafting, object manipulation and fresh wood.
       The piece explores the human desire to create: the process from vision to construction, the tragedy of work and the relationship between tools and humans. Obsessed characters discover and transform their space and themselves, transporting the spectator into a unique DIY experience.
       Sawdust Symphony is an intense dialogue between satisfaction, frustration and the smell of gasoline. Sawdust Symphony has been performed over 100 times across nine countries.

    copy_long: Fringe favourites 21Common return for a dance spectacular mashing
      karaoke carnage and feats of physical endurance with chucking out time at
      the Grand Ole Oprey. Using tropes of Western movies, it explores how
      poverty and violence shape a man. This is a deep and dirty dive into a
      family circle that more often resembles a ring of fire. Part saloon
      (there’s crooner country classics), speakeasy (brush/scuffing danceathons)
      and bare knuckle boxing ring (it’s going to kick off`), join us in our
      Wild West sitting room with the ones who spit and the ones born to fight.

      The Best Man Show is an interactive and darkly hilarious wedding reception
      where comedian Mark Vigeant plays the Groom’s brother Paul, who has been
      asked to give the toast at an untraditional polyamorous commitment
      ceremony.


      It starts out fun and silly, with your typical masculine roasting and ribbing – and slowly devolves into a drunken existential crisis where Paul tries desperately to understand what it means to love, but can’t get over his own masculinity to recognize how lonely he is.


      Filled with laughter, singing, dancing, crying, screaming, clowning, bubbles, audience participation, and more.

      In the darkness of grief, a man hears something calling. Something – or
      someone – is reaching out. But why now? And from where? Desperate for
      answers, he follows the sound deep into the Space Between. 

      But the rules are different here, and time is running out. Able to manipulate the sea of sounds around him, can he piece together the truth before it’s too late? What would we say to the people we’ve lost? A sonic adventure into the unknown using live sound manipulation technology as a gateway to a world beyond.

    copy_long: In the game of televised warfare, it is unclear who's allowed to say
      'we' anymore. One toy land is turned into another. Nobel prize winner
      Elfriede Jelinek’s text dismantles the global media war machine as
      accounts of Iraq’s invasion collapse into a child refugee’s memories of
      the Bosnian war. The violent act of representation is played back before
      our eyes on video and we find ourselves immersed in this battle of toy
      soldiers. It all comes back around, especially the wars.

      Morag’s death left a silence in her place. When her Canadian
      grand-daughter Sam inherits Morag’s piano, Sam also inherits the mystery
      of her Scottish granny’s story. An intimate letter composed of fragmented
      ballads leads Sam to uncover Morag’s possible queerness and discover a
      voice of her own.


      This dynamic experimental musical is a love letter to ancestors who “didn’t fit” that playfully warps, disrupts and reconfigures traditional Scottish ballad singing. Audiences are invited on a journey where original compositions are interwoven with electronic loops to tell old stories anew.
