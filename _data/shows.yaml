      the form of three white guys named John filmmaker John Hughes, musician
      John Mayer and rock star Jon Bon Jovi. Which is sorta unexpected because
      she's an American Black woman from the South. But at major turning points
      in her life, when she is paralysed with fear, they appear, giving her
      inspiration and courage. A heartwarming, life-affirming mix of comedy and
      storytelling about three very unlikely guardian angels

      clown, drag and queer joy reminds us it's never too late to embrace your
      true self. Created and performed by Edu Díaz, a Fulbright-awarded artist
      from the Canary Islands, A Drag is Born has won five awards, including

      Chickadee TV Studios as Chickadee the Sexy Clown. Her childlike mission to
      bring joy and connection into a world of chaos is misunderstood. She is
      heartbroken to be valued through her sexual appeal rather than her art of
      clowning. A clash between pop culture and the art of clowning. Where does
      the need to bring joy come from? Why become a clown when you can have a

    copy_long: "'What if our aloneness isn't a tragedy? What if our aloneness is
      what allows us to speak the truth without being afraid?' A Jewish actor
      and predominantly Jewish team bring to life the story of Rachel Corrie, a
      courageous 23-year-old American who left her comfortable life in 2003 to
      stand between an Israeli bulldozer and a Palestinian home in Gaza. The
      script is based on Corrie's own words, edited for the stage by Alan
      Rickman and Katherine Viner. This production offers an intimate, urgent
      exploration of resistance, hope and humanity in the face of injustice."
