    copy_long: "Jack is a 29 year old Kindergarten teacher and hopeless romantic. So
      when the love of his life leaves him for another man, Jack is heartbroken.
      Determined to find happiness by sheer willpower alone, Jack re-enters the

      Jack soon spirals out of control and finds himself in a therapist's office
      wondering, 'What now?' A critical and box-office sensation on premiere in
      Vancouver, Jack Goes to Therapy is a brilliant, enchanting, laugh-out-loud
      one-man play. "
