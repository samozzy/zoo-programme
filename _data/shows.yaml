    copy_long: Ever felt the hand of fate giving you a shove? Andrea Coleman has. In
      the form of three white guys named John filmmaker John Hughes, musician
      John Mayer and rock star Jon Bon Jovi. Which is sorta unexpected because
      she's an American Black woman from the South. But at major turning points
      in her life, when she is paralysed with fear, they appear, giving her
      inspiration and courage. A heartwarming, life-affirming mix of comedy and
      storytelling about three very unlikely guardian angels

    copy_long: In a twist of fate, an ordinary man finds himself magically
      transformed into the Queen of the Carnival. With advanced age, abundant
      body hair and limited talents, he is an unlikely candidate. Praised as a
      'whimsical tour de force' (Orlando Weekly), this non-verbal blend of
      clown, drag and queer joy reminds us it's never too late to embrace your
      true self. Created and performed by Edu Díaz, a Fulbright-awarded artist
      from the Canary Islands, A Drag is Born has won five awards, including
      Best Solo Clown (NYC Fringe) and Best Solo Show (Orlando Fringe).

      A female street clown accidentally becomes famous overnight as *Chickadee
      the Sexy Clown.*\

      Her childlike mission to bring joy to a world of chaos is misunderstood, leaving her heartbroken and questioning her worth.


      A surreal, soul-searching solo show about pop culture, performance, and the price of being seen.


      *Where does the need to bring joy come from?*\

      *Why be a clown when you could have a serious job?*\

      *What makes your heart ache?*\

      *Dare to be a fool with Chickadee?*

      A one-man (and one puppet) musical journey through a zombie outbreak,

      Berlin, 1933. Heinz goes out to the cinema and never comes home. London,
      2023. Clare claims the German citizenship her grandad Heinz gave up, but
      is it hers to take? 


      In the shadow of Brexit, Clare shines a light on her grandfather’s extraordinary true story - taking a journey from the cabaret scene of 1930s Berlin to becoming an 'enemy alien' in 1940s Britain, getting arrested by everyone from the Soviets to Winston Churchill along the way.


      A vivid account of one Jewish refugee trying to find his way home, and his granddaughter searching for her roots.

      Upside-down or right side up? On purpose or by accident? How do you like
      your eggs? From the mischievous minds of Full Out Formula comes I Think It
      Could Work, a daring and playful leap into the unexpected. With bright
      colours, dazzling acrobatics and unflinching trust, this Chicago-based
      contemporary circus collective invites you into a speculative world where
      your choices decide their destiny. It's circus like you've never seen
      before: live, improvised and unforgettable


      *[Extant](https://extant.org.uk/)* in partnership with ZOO  – presents Enhance 


       Visually impaired access has been created for this show post-production, devised by an Extant visually impaired facilitator. This is not audio description, but instead an ‘enhanced’ way of providing access that has been tried and tested by Extant.


       We invite visually impaired audiences to come along and experience the programme notes and touch tour before the show beginning at 16:30 on 12th August. The notes encapsulate the visual aspects of the show and are written with access for visually impaired audiences at the core. The Touch Tour offers exploration of set, props and costume: offering an immersive space in which to imagine the work before the show begins.


       *‘Very descriptive and it allowed me to create a visual picture in my head.’*


      Extant Enhance 2023-26 is funded by Paul Hamlyn Foundation and Arts Council England.

      a strong theme with an emphasis on humanism. Thrilling, impressive dance
      which is an expression of total theatre, invites the spectator to a
      mystically decadent, visually compact freak show, over which the magical
      theatre dust of something ancient hovers. The world, inspired by the
      phenomenon of the nineteenth century, says a lot about our contemporary
      world. Panoptikum is about the fear of the stranger and the unknown, but
      also courage and hope. The multi award-winning dance theatre company
      returns to the Fringe! The Theatre Newspaper Award. Thalia Award Nominee.

      followers. But when 15th-century mystic Margery of Kempe starts haunting
      her, Megan begins to wonder if she’s losing her grip – or if Margery is
      really there. As their connection grows unnervingly intense, Megan finds
      herself drawn to Margery in ways she can't explain, where devotion and
      desire bleed together. In this darkly funny comedy-drama, an internet
      "trad wife" influencer's carefully curated life unravels in an unexpected
      clash of past and present. Meg & Marge explores faith, feminism and the
      perils of performative perfection.

      Visually impaired access has been created for this show post-production, devised by an Extant visually impaired facilitator. This is not audio description, but instead an ‘enhanced’ way of providing access that has been tried and tested by Extant.


      We invite visually impaired audiences to come along and experience the programme notes and touch tour before the show beginning at 18:15 on 13th August. The notes encapsulate the visual aspects of the show and are written with access for visually impaired audiences at the core. The Touch Tour offers exploration of set, props and costume: offering an immersive space in which to imagine the work before the show begins.


      *‘Very descriptive and it allowed me to create a visual picture in my head.’*

    copy_long: The play, staged completely in the dark and performed by a cast
      composed by both blind and sighted actors, tells the story of a maid and
      her employer who are undergoing cancer treatment at the same time. The two
      are at different stages of the disease, with the maid practically cured
      and the employer starting chemotherapy. Despite the delicate subject, the
      plot unfolds with great lightness, humour and sensitivity, deepening the
      discussion about the emotional, social and behavioral aspects of the
      disease. The plot is all about generosity, empathy, love, fear,
      overcoming, respect and self esteem

      wild swimming, of talking trees and the scent of the seasons turning. In
      fact she's wondering if she might be a witch... Join Batty and her
      companion Wildthing for gossip, gay abandon, exquisite tenderness and
      raucous stories (with a side order of ranting), as they explore the magic
      and power of ageing. This new production from Victoria Firth and Company
      explores the wildness – as opposed to madness of women, and how our feral
      side can reconnect us to ourselves and our environment.

      This sibling jumps through a timeline of growing up with a brother who has
      severe learning disabilities. Big Little Sister is a journey through
      surrealist storytelling, sketches and monologues, accompanied by the
      ethereal voice of her brother’s communication aid. But what happens when
      you're made to grow up too quickly? What happens when these memories
      aren’t all happy? When you are forced to address the future??Holly
      Gifford’s debut play is a tribute to all glass children. This is a story
      of shared madness, lack of control and abundant love.


      *[Extant](https://extant.org.uk/ "https\://extant.org.uk/")* in partnership with  ZOO– presents Enhance. 


      Visually impaired access has been created for this show post-production, devised by an Extant visually impaired facilitator. This is not audio description, but instead an ‘enhanced’ way of providing access that has been tried and tested by Extant.


       We invite visually impaired audiences to come along and experience the programme notes and touch tour before the show beginning at 9:35 on 12th August . The notes encapsulate the visual aspects of the show and are written with access for visually impaired audiences at the core. The Touch Tour offers exploration of set, props and costume: offering an immersive space in which to imagine the work before the show begins.


       *‘Very descriptive and it allowed me to create a visual picture in my head.’*


       


      Extant Enhance 2023-26 is funded by Paul Hamlyn Foundation and Arts Council England.

    copy_long: Aspiring nihilist (and accidental optimist) Wayne Stewart wrestles
      with meaning and purpose as he reflects on why he walked 650 miles across
      France alone in July 2021. What begins as a search for answers unravels
      into something far less certain – a journey of unexpected humour,
      heartfelt reflection and a peculiar obsession with the colour yellow.

    copy_long: One courier. One impossible delivery. How far will he go to complete
      his order? Fresh from sold-out performances and five-star reviews at both
      Perth and Adelaide Fringe, Courier is a gripping dark comedy written and
      performed by Piers MacKenzie and originally directed by Rachel McMurray.
      Based on Piers' time as a Deliveroo cyclist, this solo show dives into a
      fractured mind where isolation, identity and obsession collide as the
      brakes come off. Strap on your helmets and grip those handlebars tight –
      this ride is full of sharp twists, sudden turns and plenty of bumps along
      the way

      Can one Jewish comedian relate herself to Anne Frank? Although one of the
      most famous and recognisable young women in the world, Frank's legacy is
      often simplified so she can remain a saintly beacon from one of humanity's
      darkest chapters. Now that we find ourselves in yet another dark chapter,
      come laugh, celebrate, and mourn as filtered through her nose-job, Bat
      Mitzvah, and a one-night stand with a German. She's trying to meet the
      moment but showing up fashionably late (with snacks) instead.

      Hackney Showroom Production in Association with Brixton House & Royal
      Court Theatre\

      \

      *“For the first time in my life, everything was silent”*


      A memory: reggae pioneer **Sutara Gayle AKA Lorna Gee** hears her radio debut from Holloway Prison. Another: She’s engulfed in the Brixton uprising sparked by the police shooting of her sister. And now she is here, at a silent retreat, seeking spiritual guidance from her brother Mooji and ancestor Nanny of the Maroons, and a moment of transcendence.


      Powered by high-octane musical numbers, virtuoso performance and raucous comedy, ***The Legends of Them*** is a breath-taking, roof-raising chronicle of Sutara’s singular, extraordinary life – and of the legends that have guided her.\

      ★★★★★ “Absorbing and visceral” The Stage\

      ★★★★★ “A tour de force” Afridiziak\

      ★★★★ “Pummelling and powerful” Time Out\

    copy_long: "The Ego is a bold and humorous theatre performance by Anemone Valcke
      and Verona Verbakel (known from Sirens by Ontroerend Goed). They explore
      how transgressive behavior, internalised misogyny and #MeToo shape their
      lives. With two chairs, a screen and sharp wit, they share real stories
      with shameless honesty. Blending dry humour and tragically comic film
      clips, the show is both confronting and entertaining. Without blaming
      victims or pointing fingers at perpetrators, The Ego humorously exposes
      the dysfunctional system behind such behavior, inviting the audience to
      reflect on power, complicity and credibility."

      April 1986, when the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded in Ukraine.
      This is not a reconstruction of events, but of emotions – through the eyes
      and voice of Lyudmila, the wife of a firefighter. The piece explores the
      deeply human side of the tragedy. Her words are drawn from Voices from
      Chernobyl by Nobel Laureate Svetlana Alexievich. Performed by Elena
      Arvigo, one of Italy's most intense stage actresses, the monologue won
      Italy's top award for solo performance. A hymn to life in the darkest
      moments."

      as a Christian Arab kid in Haifa, now raising two Jewish-Arab kids in
