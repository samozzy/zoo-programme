      when the love of his life leaves him for another man, Jack is heartbroken.
      Determined to find happiness by sheer willpower alone, Jack re-enters the
      dating world with a vengeance. Dating new men left, right, and centre,
      Jack soon spirals out of control and finds himself in a therapist's office
      wondering, 'What now?' A critical and box-office sensation on premiere in
      Vancouver, Jack Goes to Therapy is a brilliant, enchanting, laugh-out-loud
      one-man play. "

  - copy_long: Ever felt the hand of fate giving you a shove? Andrea Coleman has. In
      the form of three white guys named John filmmaker John Hughes, musician
      John Mayer and rock star Jon Bon Jovi. Which is sorta unexpected because
      she's an American Black woman from the South. But at major turning points
      in her life, when she is paralysed with fear, they appear, giving her
      inspiration and courage. A heartwarming, life-affirming mix of comedy and
      storytelling about three very unlikely guardian angels

  - copy_long: In a twist of fate, an ordinary man finds himself magically
      transformed into the Queen of the Carnival. With advanced age, abundant
      body hair and limited talents, he is an unlikely candidate. Praised as a
      'whimsical tour de force' (Orlando Weekly), this non-verbal blend of
      clown, drag and queer joy reminds us it's never too late to embrace your
      true self. Created and performed by Edu Díaz, a Fulbright-awarded artist
      from the Canary Islands, A Drag is Born has won five awards, including
      Best Solo Clown (NYC Fringe) and Best Solo Show (Orlando Fringe).

      digital technology. In a choreography impregnated by the martial practice
      of the two dancers, and accessible from age 7+, these universes meet and
      mix to create a duet that combines humour, precision of gesture and beauty
      of movement.
