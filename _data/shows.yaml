      Writer/performer Jenny Witzel tells her story of living on a boat in an
      “up-and-coming” neighbourhood in South-East London. Born out of protest,
      CREEKSHOW is a love-letter to Deptford Creek and a community fighting for
      the right to remain. Addressing the wider problem of regeneration, it
      exposes the real-life impact of the current housing and cost-of-living
      crises. Bringing to life an archive of mudlarked artefacts, CREEKSHOW is a
      multimedia exploration of a place transformed beyond recognition. 
        
      Praise for director Luke Lewin Davies’ previous work: \*\*\*\*\* (British Theatre) \*\*\*\* (The List)

      With sound design by 2023 Offie Award Winner Calum Perrin.

      Stuck In Free Fall is a show about Nothing. In this genre-bending solo
      performance Nicola Bullock celebrates the contribution that "Nothing" - a
      feeling, state, need, or otherwise- has made to our individual psyches and
      the collective unconscious. As she guides the audience through a wild,
      serious, experimental, and thought-provoking collective reading of her
      artist book, a ritual is born. Featuring dance, poetry, and love letters
      to the void, Stuck In Free Fall insists that Nothing- invisible,
      impossible, and accessed only through imagination- invites us to believe
      in belief and trust the unknown.

      Gerry Carroll - Young 

      The Scotsman said his 2022 show was "Strangely sweet and raw, properly, honestly personal". Gerry’s got 70 years experience to play with and he was awarded an Arts Council grant to develop this show. He mashes up clown, stand-up and internal auditing in a unique show. He's "charmingly defiant", Chortle. Gerry starts by retelling the story of an old Irish legend who went to the Land of the Young and came back to find that many years had passed and he turned into a wrinkly old man. Come and see!

      Two Russian artists in exile reveal the cruelty of Soviet life with a good
      dose of dark humour. The award-winning Spitfire return to Edinburgh with a
      project influenced by the books of Nobel Prize laureate Svetlana
      Alexievich. Chilling jokes, the absurdity of the situation and efforts at
      trivialisation are the key features of a production built on the
      testimonies of witnesses of wars, the Chernobyl disaster and the collapse
      of the USSR. Live cinema employing puppet animation and starring food,
      inspired by works of Jan Švankmajer, provides fitting stylisation.

      Lecoq-trained physical performer and Fool, Saskia Solomons morphs into a
      myriad of inner personalities as they wrestle with the ickiest of sticky
      icks: money. Daring to dive headfirst into the belly of the
      elephant-in-the-room, this semi-improvised solo is a ridiculous and
      disarmingly honest exploration of belonging, class and inequality by a
      closet rich kid.

      Tragically weird. Unnecessarily sexual. Two Cats on a Date is exactly what
      it sounds like. And then much worse. A high-energy solo show in which one
      woman plays two cats whose romantic dinner kaleidoscopes into a world of
      intergenerational regret.

      Travellers! Come along the journey of your life to the land of holiday
      wishes, dreams... and nightmare scenarios! “It’s not the destination, but
      the journey" our three loveable tourist must endure, as their unique dream
      vacation turns into a chaotic battle ground over the claim of beautiful
      uninhabited landscapes, swimmingpools and roasted pigs or croissants and
      cortados at a sidewalkcafé in Nice.
        
      An actionpacked, physical comedy about life as a tourist and about how encountering others can bring both the best and the worst out in us. Maybe we do not have to travel far to come far?

      Funeral


      'I don't believe in God but I miss him' 

      ?(Nothing to be Frightened Of, Julian Barnes)


      A collective ritual about the finiteness of things.

      It will start in the dark.

      We will greet others and say goodbye.

      There will be singing and pretending.

      There will be light and room for darkness.

      We’ll light candles, eat and drink and celebrate life.

      And all of that will end.

      Welcome. 


      A theatrical ceremony, a new ritual that brings people together. Because everything is finite and we are going to have to live with that.

      Discover this iconic Flemish play by Cyriel Buysse. Through the lens of a
      story set in 1903, it dissects our Western world where, to this day,
      classes and communities don’t speak the same language, and where
      oppression by the one percent has resulted in a fierce social struggle.

      These past 12 years, Dhaenens has travelled the world with the hit monologues BigmoutH and SmallWaR. In his latest show, Dhaenens recreates a major Flemish theatre classic by seamlessly slipping into 13 different characters to engage in a dialogue with as many digital individuals.

      In times of hypervelocity and fear of missing out, what happens when we
      are asked to wait, to queue up? 


      The award-winning actress Marleen Scholten created a piece on waiting, partially based on the true story of an Italian man that lost his job and stood in line for others.


      La codista is a tragicomic, personal and political reflection on identity and slowing down. (Wonderful jewel\*\*\*\**)


      Winner of the national playwriting award ‘Antonio Conti’, Italy 2020.


      Selected at the Dutch Theatre Festival as of one the best performances of the year 2022.

      samba-reggae vibes seek joy and hope in this broken world.

      “WHY DO I SPEAK ENGLISH??”


      I have been asked this in an accusatory manner. I’ve been offended by it sometimes.. I’ve often wondered.. “What’s all the fuss about? Isn’t it just a language?”


      Recently, I decided to become a full-time actor in my country - India. Suddenly, it was difficult to find work, as I mainly spoke English, in a so-called “non-English speaking nation.”


      Thus, started my journey to find answers. 


      Using a perfect blend of contemporary dance and the spoken word, I tell my personal story through my unique physical language. 


      Come and watch a glimpse of my life!

      Celebrating the strength of mature bodies and challenging the cult of
      youth, the show is a reclaiming of the ageing body created by
      dance-theatre innovators Junk Ensemble. Performed by acclaimed actor Mikel
      Murfi &amp; leading dance artist Finola Cronin (formerly of Pina Bausch’s
      Tanztheater Wuppertal), the performers are heroic, vulnerable, comedic,
      and completely themselves in the work. They care fiercely for each other
      and defend their independence. As they hold each other up and push each
      other down, the ‘performance’ of age is unpacked as a reminder of
      ourselves: our worst and our best.

      A 21st century contemporary dance cabaret. Underneath twisted dance
      numbers, physical challenges and funny fragmented conversations is my
      desire to be cool and groovy. A collective discovery about who we are,
      what we like and how we coexist together. Physicality and music with
      language and humour, it can be a bit strange, a bit provocative and a
      touch sarcastic. We come to an end and we’ve got lost in the groove, in
      the moving, in the moment. We’re all slightly altered, like the end of a
      great gig we’ve come somewhere together. A laughing, grooving pocket of
      humanity.

      Inspired by Shakespeare’s ‘Titus Andronicus’, featuring original text and
      music which depict the extreme cruelty resulting from retaliation. Song of
      the Goat’s signature staging of topical issues now turns to the ongoing
      war in Europe in this brutal and uncompromising warning of where the path
      of revenge and cruelty leads. Drawing from reportage, Andronicus
      Synecdoche reaches for the topos and the universally recognizable myth,
      creating a symbolic image of war as a field of the moral decline of
      humanity. War lasts as long as revenge takes.\

      \

      only one hour before he ripens. Banana employs stand-up, physical comedy,
      karaoke, magic, and more to explore what it means to be the world's most
      popular fruit.

      In a holding room, participants wait. A pageant is about to begin. No call
      time, perpetual purgatory. Following a scorching premiere at NOW 23
      Festival, music-duo and dance company Bullyache make their Edinburgh debut
      with Tom. Blending the myth of Orpheus with the DWP, Tom is a
      vertigo-inducing pop-culture collision of working class and queer
      expression. With original live music and dance, Tom oscillates between
      hyper-speed pop, ambient waves, and auto-tune vocals. Bullyache and cast
      burst into song, they fight, f'\*\*, live, laugh, and love...
      deconstructing the price of being in a world that demands too much.

      The world will end in exactly 80 years—just enough time to have a baby!
      This devised dark comedy follows two couples (and a surrogate) as they
      prepare to welcome new life into a dying world. With doomsday just outside
      of their natural lifespan, certain death is close enough to inform every
      decision, but far enough away to ignore in a pinch.

      A dance-performance that explores the working body across two seemingly
      distant sectors: agriculture and dance.


      How do we humans shape and cultivate nature and how does a trade shape us? What is it to cultivate a body?


      In HARVEST two performers from different traditions: a contemporary dancer and a neo-flamenco dancer embody these questions in a set that incorporates soil and grass.


      A large reverberating floor with audience on the round becomes a giant speaker, shaking the room and setting the soil, the dancers and the whole space in motion. Part of #DANISH showcase.

      Figs in Wigs are back and this time they've got their period (dresses). A
      live art, feminist "adaptation" of Louisa May Alcott's novel Little Women.
      Wild, irreverent, and cosmically comical, it dismantles the canon, making
      way for the doomed future of humankind. Prepare to laugh at the theatrical
      traditions and poke fun at our obsession with "the classics" as the Figs
      use the story as a trojan horse, turning it on its head and mutating it
      into an unrecognisable cartoon catastrophe about climate change,
      astrology, and the infinite nature of the universe. PS Beth dies.

      "Breath-taking, heart-stopping, terrifying" - Cherwell Newspaper
        
      Atop a lonely rock, by the side of a dirt road, in an indeterminate, inhospitable expanse, sits a beggar. Along the very same dirt road comes a man, a bag of apples slung around his neck, dragging behind him a tremendously heavy coffin by a rope. Neither of them seem to know who it’s for. Neither are in a rush to find out; they know that they both will, in time. Such is the general futility of things, such as they are. There’s supper to be had in the meantime.

      Elizabeth Holmes claims her biotechnology will revolutionise medicine -
      and people believe her. A single drop of blood, she claims, can be used
      for up to 800 blood tests. As she defrauds investors of hundreds of
      millions of dollars and uses her disastrous technology to test real
      patients, does she think she's doing anything wrong? This devised verbatim
      play, based on interviews, newly released trial exhibits, text messages,
      and Holmes's personal notes, asks questions about the gap between
      appearance and reality as it delves into the mind of the fraudster once
      considered guaranteed to change the world.

      Sex-Ed Revisited is a five-star interactive comedy uncovering missing gaps
      in knowledge when it comes to female-focused sex education and our
      relationship with pleasure. A theatrical quest for climax that takes its
      audience on a Kylie-inspired sex-pop adventure. Gone are the days of
      attempting to put condoms on cucumbers, whilst wearing kaleidoscopic beer
      goggles. A retelling of sex education unlike any you have ever experienced
      before. 'Sex-Ed Revisited is not only one of the funniest pieces of
      theatre I've seen but also one of the most educational'\*\*\*\*\*

      1903\. The Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) is formed in
      Manchester - but not everyone agrees with change. Far from the protests,
      four women are fighting their own personal battle searching for truth. A
      body has gone missing. And the blood is on all their hands. This is not a
      question of who committed the crime - everyone's guilty of that. The
      question is who took the body and why? And what will be the consequences?
      A murder mystery, but different.

      Bang is a monologue delivered by the apparition of Joan Vollmer,
      immediately after she was shot by William Burroughs, her common law
      husband, in Mexico City in 1951. As she waits for the ambulance to arrive,
      she reflects on her relationship with the famous writer, on the passionate
      nucleus that launched the Beat movement, and on a murder in that
      close-knit group of artists, presaging her own death.

      If you knew my story, your heart would break too. Escaping a traumatic
      childhood, a young woman arrives in London. She soon finds herself as 'the
      leading lady in drama she can't comprehend'. The gaslighting is subtle,
      the manipulation slick. Can she escape or is she destined to relive the
      devastation of past events? Havisham offers a fresh perspective of Charles
      Dickens' greatest work of Gothic characterisation. As the embodiment of
      stuck trauma and malignant rage, Miss Havisham both fascinates and repels.
      But how did she arrive at this place and what are the tragic secrets?

    copy_long: A buddy comedy for an existential generation. Mel and Em carry the
      responsibilities of the modern age. Through anecdotes of much-loved
      aunties and much-hated colleagues, they reveal their plans to change the
      world. Em soon finds herself her dad’s next of kin, forcing personal and
      global crises to collide. Fast-talking story about female friendship, and
      our responsibility to those around us. When being pulled in all
      directions, whose voice do you listen to? End of the World explores what’s
      expected of us, what we put on ourselves and the cost of putting someone
      else first.

      "Report to an Academy"

      by Franz Kafka Adapted and directed by Gabriele Jakobi

      with Robert McNamara
        
      An ape named Red Peter has evolved to behave like a human. He presents his fascinating tale of transformation-- and the horrid details of his former ape life-- to a top scientific Academy. Based on the classic short story by the master of existential storytelling Franz Kafka. Adapted for the stage by acclaimed German director Gabriele Jakobi. Don't miss SCENA's wild parable brought to life. McNamara's return to the stage is riveting. He will compel you to ponder the issues of free will, vegetarianism, and animal rights.

      She doesn’t trust him. Not after Barbados, anyway. 

      Five friends travel to a country estate for a birthday party turned surprise wedding. Everyone’s in love with everyone, and everyone hates everyone. But desire and violence are two sides of the same coin, as they learn throughout the fated, whiskey-drenched night. Debauchery is expected, but what isn’t is for the blushing young bride to turn up dead. Who killed her? Maybe we all did. Trust is a dark comedic indictment of privilege in a world where consequences don’t exist for those who can write a big enough cheque.

      When Ruva experiences street harassment, her entire world is thrown into
      chaos and turmoil. Raging against the system and a society who won’t take
      her seriously, Ruva turns into a Beast, searching for a way to empower
      herself and fight the creatures that lurk at night. 


      Part spoken word, part outcry, inspired by lived experiences and intertwined with Zimbabwean beliefs about spirituality and magical realism, BEASTS explores the impact of street harassment, and how we’re supposed to feel safe when those sworn to protect us admit they can’t.
