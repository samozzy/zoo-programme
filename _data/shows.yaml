    venue: ZOO Southside
    duration: 
    company: Jenny Witzel
    copy_long: |
      Writer/performer Jenny Witzel tells her story of living on a boat in an “up-and-coming” neighbourhood in South-East London. Born out of protest, CREEKSHOW is a love-letter to Deptford Creek and a community fighting for the right to remain. Addressing the wider problem of regeneration, it exposes the real-life impact of the current housing and cost-of-living crises. Bringing to life an archive of mudlarked artefacts, CREEKSHOW is a multimedia exploration of a place transformed beyond recognition.

    duration: 
    company: Nicola Bullock Dances / NB(D)
    copy_long: |
      Stuck In Free Fall is a show about Nothing. In this genre-bending solo performance Nicola Bullock celebrates the contribution that "Nothing" - a feeling, state, need, or otherwise- has made to our individual psyches and the collective unconscious. As she guides the audience through a wild, serious, experimental, and thought-provoking collective reading of her artist book, a ritual is born. Featuring dance, poetry, and love letters to the void, Stuck In Free Fall insists that Nothing- invisible, impossible, and accessed only through imagination- invites us to believe in belief and trust the unknown.

      Gerry Carroll - Young 
      The Scotsman said his 2022 show was "Strangely sweet and raw, properly, honestly personal". Gerry’s got 70 years experience to play with and he was awarded an Arts Council grant to develop this show. He mashes up clown, stand-up and internal auditing in a unique show. He's "charmingly defiant", Chortle. Gerry starts by retelling the story of an old Irish legend who went to the Land of the Young and came back to find that many years had passed and he turned into a wrinkly old man. Come and see!

  - title: The Last of the Soviets
    venue: ZOO Playground
    duration: 
    company: Spitfire Company
    copy_long: |
      Two Russian artists in exile reveal the cruelty of Soviet life with a good dose of dark humour. The award-winning Spitfire return to Edinburgh with a project influenced by the books of Nobel Prize laureate Svetlana Alexievich. Chilling jokes, the absurdity of the situation and efforts at trivialisation are the key features of a production built on the testimonies of witnesses of wars, the Chernobyl disaster and the collapse of the USSR. Live cinema employing puppet animation and starring food, inspired by works of Jan Švankmajer, provides fitting stylisation.

      Lecoq-trained physical performer and Fool, Saskia Solomons morphs into a myriad of inner personalities as they wrestle with the ickiest of sticky icks: money. Daring to dive headfirst into the belly of the elephant-in-the-room, this semi-improvised solo is a ridiculous and disarmingly honest exploration of belonging, class and inequality by a closet rich kid.

      Tragically weird. Unnecessarily sexual. Two Cats on a Date is exactly what it sounds like. And then much worse. A high-energy solo show in which one woman plays two cats whose romantic dinner kaleidoscopes into a world of intergenerational regret.

      'I don't believe in God but I miss him' 
      ?(Nothing to be Frightened Of, Julian Barnes)
      
      A collective ritual about the finiteness of things.
      It will start in the dark.
      We will greet others and say goodbye.
      There will be singing and pretending.
      There will be light and room for darkness.
      We’ll light candles, eat and drink and celebrate life.
      And all of that will end.
      Welcome. 
      
      A theatrical ceremony, a new ritual that brings people together. Because everything is finite and we are going to have to live with that.

      Discover this iconic Flemish play by Cyriel Buysse. Through the lens of a story set in 1903, it dissects our Western world where, to this day, classes and communities don’t speak the same language, and where oppression by the one percent has resulted in a fierce social struggle.
      These past 12 years, Dhaenens has travelled the world with the hit monologues BigmoutH and SmallWaR. In his latest show, Dhaenens recreates a major Flemish theatre classic by seamlessly slipping into 13 different characters to engage in a dialogue with as many digital individuals.

      This simple question, made me dig deep and transported me to places I never imagined.
      
      What this means in my country - India - is not a simple answer.
      
      I decided to search on my own and not blindly believe what the scholars were telling us. I wanted first-hand information!
      
      Why is there so much importance given to this language in a non-English-speaking nation? 
      
      Will I find the answers I’m looking for?
      
      Join my journey of revelations, through theatre and contemporary dance.
      
      Don't miss out on this unforgettable experience that promises to captivate, provoke, and inspire!

    company: Junk Ensemble
    copy_long: |
      Celebrating the strength of mature bodies and challenging the cult of youth, the show is a reclaiming of the ageing body created by dance-theatre innovators Junk Ensemble. Performed by acclaimed actor Mikel Murfi &amp; leading dance artist Finola Cronin (formerly of Pina Bausch’s Tanztheater Wuppertal), the performers are heroic, vulnerable, comedic, and completely themselves in the work. They care fiercely for each other and defend their independence. As they hold each other up and push each other down, the ‘performance’ of age is unpacked as a reminder of ourselves: our worst and our best.

      A 21st century contemporary dance cabaret. Underneath twisted dance numbers, physical challenges and funny fragmented conversations is my desire to be cool and groovy. A collective discovery about who we are, what we like and how we coexist together. Physicality and music with language and humour, it can be a bit strange, a bit provocative and a touch sarcastic. We come to an end and we’ve got lost in the groove, in the moving, in the moment. We’re all slightly altered, like the end of a great gig we’ve come somewhere together. A laughing, grooving pocket of humanity.

    duration: 
    company: Song of the Goat Theatre
    copy_long: |
      Inspired by Shakespeare’s ‘Titus Andronicus’, featuring original text and music which depict the extreme cruelty resulting from retaliation. Song of the Goat’s signature staging of topical issues now turns to the ongoing war in Europe in this brutal and uncompromising warning of where the path of revenge and cruelty leads. Drawing from reportage, Andronicus Synecdoche reaches for the topos and the universally recognizable myth, creating a symbolic image of war as a field of the moral decline of humanity. War lasts as long as revenge takes.

      In a holding room, participants wait. A pageant is about to begin. No call time, perpetual purgatory. Following a scorching premiere at NOW 23 Festival, music-duo and dance company Bullyache make their Edinburgh debut with Tom. Blending the myth of Orpheus with the DWP, Tom is a vertigo-inducing pop-culture collision of working class and queer expression. With original live music and dance, Tom oscillates between hyper-speed pop, ambient waves, and auto-tune vocals. Bullyache and cast burst into song, they fight, f'**, live, laugh, and love... deconstructing the price of being in a world that demands too much.

      The world will end in exactly 80 years—just enough time to have a baby! This devised dark comedy follows two couples (and a surrogate) as they prepare to welcome new life into a dying world.

      A dance-performance that explores the working body across two seemingly distant sectors: agriculture and dance.
        
      How do we humans shape and cultivate nature and how does a trade shape us? What is it to cultivate a body?
        
      In HARVEST two performers from different traditions: a contemporary dancer and a neo-flamenco dancer embody these questions in a set that incorporates soil and grass.
        
      A large reverberating floor with audience on the round becomes a giant speaker, shaking the room and setting the soil, the dancers and the whole space in motion. Part of #DANISH showcase.

      Figs in Wigs are back and this time they've got their period (dresses). A live art, feminist "adaptation" of Louisa May Alcott's novel Little Women. Wild, irreverent, and cosmically comical, it dismantles the canon, making way for the doomed future of humankind. Prepare to laugh at the theatrical traditions and poke fun at our obsession with "the classics" as the Figs use the story as a trojan horse, turning it on its head and mutating it into an unrecognisable cartoon catastrophe about climate change, astrology, and the infinite nature of the universe. PS Beth dies.

      "Breath-taking, heart-stopping, terrifying" - Cherwell Newspaper
        
      Atop a lonely rock, by the side of a dirt road, in an indeterminate, inhospitable expanse, sits a beggar. Along the very same dirt road comes a man, a bag of apples slung around his neck, dragging behind him a tremendously heavy coffin by a rope. Neither of them seem to know who it’s for. Neither are in a rush to find out; they know that they both will, in time. Such is the general futility of things, such as they are. There’s supper to be had in the meantime.

      Elizabeth Holmes claims her biotechnology will revolutionise medicine - and people believe her. A single drop of blood, she claims, can be used for up to 800 blood tests. As she defrauds investors of hundreds of millions of dollars and uses her disastrous technology to test real patients, does she think she's doing anything wrong? This devised verbatim play, based on interviews, newly released trial exhibits, text messages, and Holmes's personal notes, asks questions about the gap between appearance and reality as it delves into the mind of the fraudster once considered guaranteed to change the world.

      Sex-Ed Revisited is a five-star interactive comedy uncovering missing gaps in knowledge when it comes to female-focused sex education and our relationship with pleasure. A theatrical quest for climax that takes its audience on a Kylie-inspired sex-pop adventure. Gone are the days of attempting to put condoms on cucumbers, whilst wearing kaleidoscopic beer goggles. A retelling of sex education unlike any you have ever experienced before. 'Sex-Ed Revisited is not only one of the funniest pieces of theatre I've seen but also one of the most educational'\*\*\*\*\* (CfryCentreStage.wordpress.com).

Far from the protests, four women are fighting their own personal battle searching for truth. A body has gone missing. And the blood is on all their hands. This is not a question of who committed the crime - everyone's guilty of that. The question is who took the body and why? And what will be the consequences? A murder mystery, but different.

      If you knew my story, your heart would break too. Escaping a traumatic childhood, a young woman arrives in London. She soon finds herself as 'the leading lady in drama she can't comprehend'. The gaslighting is subtle, the manipulation slick. Can she escape or is she destined to relive the devastation of past events? Havisham offers a fresh perspective of Charles Dickens' greatest work of Gothic characterisation. As the embodiment of stuck trauma and malignant rage, Miss Havisham both fascinates and repels. But how did she arrive at this place and what are the tragic secrets?

      "Report to an Academy"
      by Franz Kafka Adapted and directed by Gabriele Jakobi
      with Robert McNamara
        
      An ape named Red Peter has evolved to behave like a human. He presents his fascinating tale of transformation-- and the horrid details of his former ape life-- to a top scientific Academy. Based on the classic short story by the master of existential storytelling Franz Kafka. Adapted for the stage by acclaimed German director Gabriele Jakobi. Don't miss SCENA's wild parable brought to life. McNamara's return to the stage is riveting. He will compel you to ponder the issues of free will, vegetarianism, and animal rights.

      She doesn’t trust him. Not after Barbados, anyway. 
      Five friends travel to a country estate for a birthday party turned surprise wedding. Everyone’s in love with everyone, and everyone hates everyone. But desire and violence are two sides of the same coin, as they learn throughout the fated, whiskey-drenched night. Debauchery is expected, but what isn’t is for the blushing young bride to turn up dead. Who killed her? Maybe we all did. Trust is a dark comedic indictment of privilege in a world where consequences don’t exist for those who can write a big enough cheque.
