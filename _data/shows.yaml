    copy_long: Alone in his miserable bedsit in a busy, bustling metropolis, Dante’s
      only companion is a house robot named She-bot. His girlfriend has left for
      Japan to disconnect from technology and live an older, simpler way of
      being. Dante is lost. Trapped in an unfulfilling job he hates, he embraces
      escapism by writing a film. As the screenplay emerges, we join a Spanish
      knight on a quest alongside his French squire, battling monsters and
      travelling epic landscapes. Gradually, Dante’s worlds begin to merge,
      overlap and intertwine around him.

      through complex costume changes, confrontations, and quirky actor demands,
      all while staying hidden in the shadows. When the stress of invisibility
      gets heavy, supportive allies rally and equip her to stand up, curse like
      a sailor, and be seen. This may be a solo show, but Kimberly Prentice
      quick-changes her way through thirty plus distinct characters as we follow
      Pam’s hilarious, and sometimes harrowing, journey of working in the dark,
      unseen, while trying not to disappear.

    copy_long: Inspired by encounters with people on the margins of society; a
      dissection of trauma and revival, pain and transformation. In a devotional
      setting of sinister rituals and acts of liberation, Madonna and Jesus
      appear as trash prophets. Surrounded by Paradise-Lost-iconography they
      deliver prayers for the outcasts and blessings for queer bodies. After
      their 2018 success with Baby Paradise, provocative German bambule.babys is
      returning to the Fringe with its new production. Alluding to feminist
      philosophy and politics of care, this is a piece dedicated to all those
      homesick for a better world.

    copy_long: From Frankenstein to The Invisible Man, James Whale directed some of
      the greatest movies of all time. How did a working-class boy from Dudley
      end up in Hollywood? An expressionist and out gay man working in the
      studio system at the peak of Hollywood’s golden age, his moment in the
      movie-land spotlight lasted little more than 10 years. Just who was James
      Whale? This one-person show shines a light on his life and work, examining
      a sense of otherness and the outsider, and how his films still resonate,
      90 years on.

      "I got very little, little to no media training, so... Sorry!"
       
       Sir Galahad the Pure, Knight of the Round Table, son of Lancelot the Brave, is taking a bath. Even the chosen one needs a break sometimes, okay? But long soaks in the bath can lead to painful questions, and the cleaner Galahad gets, the dirtier he becomes. In this darkly comedic show about sex, jobs, and the Holy Grail, by the time Galahad gets out, he might not want to be so Pure anymore.

      Carpentry and circus collide.
       In Sawdust Symphony Michael Zandl, David Eisele and Kolja Huneck combine their passion for crafting, object manipulation and fresh wood.
       The piece explores the human desire to create: the process from vision to construction, the tragedy of work and the relationship between tools and humans. Obsessed characters discover and transform their space and themselves, transporting the spectator into a unique DIY experience.
       Sawdust Symphony is an intense dialogue between satisfaction, frustration and the smell of gasoline. Sawdust Symphony has been performed over 100 times across nine countries.

      karaoke carnage and feats of physical endurance with chucking out time at
      the Grand Ole Oprey. Using tropes of Western movies, it explores how
      poverty and violence shape a man. This is a deep and dirty dive into a
      family circle that more often resembles a ring of fire. Part saloon
      (there’s crooner country classics), speakeasy (brush/scuffing danceathons)
      and bare knuckle boxing ring (it’s going to kick off`), join us in our
      Wild West sitting room with the ones who spit and the ones born to fight.

      The Best Man Show is an interactive and darkly hilarious wedding reception
      where comedian Mark Vigeant plays the Groom’s brother Paul, who has been
      asked to give the toast at an untraditional polyamorous commitment
      ceremony.


      It starts out fun and silly, with your typical masculine roasting and ribbing – and slowly devolves into a drunken existential crisis where Paul tries desperately to understand what it means to love, but can’t get over his own masculinity to recognize how lonely he is.


      Filled with laughter, singing, dancing, crying, screaming, clowning, bubbles, audience participation, and more.

      In the darkness of grief, a man hears something calling. Something – or
      someone – is reaching out. But why now? And from where? Desperate for
      answers, he follows the sound deep into the Space Between. 

      But the rules are different here, and time is running out. Able to manipulate the sea of sounds around him, can he piece together the truth before it’s too late? What would we say to the people we’ve lost? A sonic adventure into the unknown using live sound manipulation technology as a gateway to a world beyond.

    copy_long: In the game of televised warfare, it is unclear who's allowed to say
      'we' anymore. One toy land is turned into another. Nobel prize winner
      Elfriede Jelinek’s text dismantles the global media war machine as
      accounts of Iraq’s invasion collapse into a child refugee’s memories of
      the Bosnian war. The violent act of representation is played back before
      our eyes on video and we find ourselves immersed in this battle of toy
      soldiers. It all comes back around, especially the wars.

      Morag’s death left a silence in her place. When her Canadian
      grand-daughter Sam inherits Morag’s piano, Sam also inherits the mystery
      of her Scottish granny’s story. An intimate letter composed of fragmented
      ballads leads Sam to uncover Morag’s possible queerness and discover a
      voice of her own.


      This dynamic experimental musical is a love letter to ancestors who “didn’t fit” that playfully warps, disrupts and reconfigures traditional Scottish ballad singing. Audiences are invited on a journey where original compositions are interwoven with electronic loops to tell old stories anew.

    copy_long: A poetic, hilariously relatable, and raw coming-of-age tale of A
      Middle Eastern American boy, Essa, whose parents are refugees. Essa
      confesses the experience of growing up in a country that doesn’t have a
      place for him. Join Essa as he navigates sexuality, the demands of a
      religion passed onto him from his parents, learning the English language,
      the fleetingness of youth, and a nicotine demon that won't leave him
      alone. In a solo play told between different ages throughout his life,
      Essa gives us a soul-stirring exploration of identity and the relentless
      pursuit of self-discovery in a world that often feels indifferent. An
      honest testament to the eternal quest for belonging.

      Charlie runs a bridal shop. Clelia is getting married. The two women exist
      as strangers, their lives running in parallel without ever touching, until
      their paths intersect. As they search for the perfect dress, they spill
      secrets, laughter and desires with a familiarity that defies logic. It
      becomes clear

      that Clelia and Charlie share a connection that’s more than skin deep. A razor-sharp and heartfelt comedy exploring the shame we carry from childhood, the speed at which women become intimately connected and the people we meet briefly who leave an indelible imprint on our lives.

      When George Boucher, a troublesome youth, narrowly misses serving time in
      prison for a violent offence, he is placed with a new, unconventional
      youth officer called David. As George and David progress in their work
      together, David manages to slowly peel back George's defences and walls
      without him realising; allowing him the space and freedom to grow and
      heal.


      Sessions is a play about the confines of toxic masculinity and trauma, which aims to grapple with how trauma lives in the body – and how, when it goes unaddressed, it manifests into our behaviours and habits.

      Singing Sands is a touching yet dark comedy about how the death of a loved
      one can sometimes be the only way to restore old bonds.


      Set on the remote Hebridean Isle of Eigg, two siblings return to their late Gran’s house to find her stuff loaded into a van by their long-lost cousin. They’ve got until the ferry arrives to reconcile, grieve and resist battering each other.


      After a sold-out run last Edinburgh Fringe, 'Singing Sands' returns, showing how easy it is to forget our culture when we’ve been away from home for so long.

      Wet Mess Wet Messifies the messiness of life; exploring transitions,
      testosterone, edges of drag, blur between performance and reality, magical
      in the mundane. Meet at the computer of confused edges, for guttural
      sexuality, where made up shit becomes real.


      Wearing insides on the outsides, and waiting for the hateful crunchy key change. Expect mustache meals, desktop dreams, dykey desires, trotting, lolling, humping, titting, farting, pinching at the dull flesh of life here and here. It's quite like, uh, I just back away, I, don’t perceive me, I'm in the wall.


      Hoping you will understand Sincerely Wet xx

      This is not a show about mental health. This is a disorder. Is it
      rehearsed? That depends. Scripted? Half. Improvised? Absolutely not. Is it
      a play? No it's not a f*cking play. F*ck off. My cousin in christ, this is
      a BORDERLINE comedy. \

      Laughter! Excitement! Learning! Comedian Frisco Fred performs then teaches
      YOU - the audience to juggle! It’s fun, and great for annoying your
      downstairs neighbors. \

      \

      (Ticket price includes a juggling kit.)\

       "Deep in the basement of ZOO something magical is happening ... but the best part is left for last - when the AUDIENCE comes centre stage and learns to juggle themselves... seeing 40-something parents, 70-something grandparents and kids alike learning to juggle is a fantastic treat..." \

      Powerful performance exploring love in times of war in Europe,
      transcending Romeo & Juliet’s classic narrative, offering an enriched
      perspective and examining the complexity of human relations. \

      \

      Featuring three loving couples in diverse stages of life, displaying the artistry of four terrific dancers and two outstanding musicians.\


      At the heart of the performance lies the music, a dynamic blend and live execution of motifs drawn from prominent compositions associated with the story. Featuring works by Prokofiev, Mancini, and Gounod, the music underlines the universal theme of profound love and the cruel intrusion of death.

    copy_long: A walrus comedy (for adults). Why is the Arctic melting and where are
      all the clams? From Rishi Sunak to binge-eating seagulls, 'Thor the
      Walrus' asks why big corporations aren't blamed for climate change when we
      feel guilty about using plastic straws. Thor travels to England to
      discover why our planet is burning, meeting numerous fishy characters,
      from a flamboyant starfish to a recovering-addict crab, while a news
      programme reports his progress. (Based on a true story. Loosely.) Fans of
      'Brass Eye' and 'South Park' will love 'Thor the Walrus'. But screw them,
      Thor is getting hangry...

      You Heard Me is for anyone who has been underestimated, or told to shut
      up. 


      This is a loud show about quiet power. This is a celebration of refusing to be silenced, of taking up space and of one woman's power to re-make, re-mould and disrupt. Integrating a blend of visceral movement, enveloping sound and lights, Luca and her collaborators gift audiences the chance to experience the messiness and effort of connecting to your own power.

      wrists. Bed bugs in my flat, lurking in my mattress. Except... there were
      no bed bugs. There were never any to begin with. Based on true events,
      make the Bed is a solo piece that explores what it's like when your
      thoughts consume you. When black and white thinking takes over. When you
      have anxiety. And what it can feel like sitting with that anxiety in real
      time. And how to maybe, just maybe, go towards the grey. Directed by
      Cecilia Thoden van Velzen.

      'A flawless blend of Broadway, games, pop and comedy bliss!' (Fame
      Magazine). \

      \

      When the hero character of a video game dies, an NPC turns to the audience for help navigating their grief. Part live concert, part escape room, part immersive theatre, each performance is entirely responsive to the player style, improvisation and decisions of the audience. \

      \

      Four audience players join writer-performer Brendan Bradley on stage, wearing virtual reality headsets while the virtual world and characters are projected on the big screen, inviting both theatre and game lovers to a new kind of play.
