    copy_long: Ever felt the hand of fate giving you a shove? Andrea Coleman has. In
      the form of three white guys named John filmmaker John Hughes, musician
      John Mayer and rock star Jon Bon Jovi. Which is sorta unexpected because
      she's an American Black woman from the South. But at major turning points
      in her life, when she is paralysed with fear, they appear, giving her
      inspiration and courage. A heartwarming, life-affirming mix of comedy and
      storytelling about three very unlikely guardian angels

    copy_long: In a twist of fate, an ordinary man finds himself magically
      transformed into the Queen of the Carnival. With advanced age, abundant
      body hair and limited talents, he is an unlikely candidate. Praised as a
      'whimsical tour de force' (Orlando Weekly), this non-verbal blend of
      clown, drag and queer joy reminds us it's never too late to embrace your
      true self. Created and performed by Edu Díaz, a Fulbright-awarded artist
      from the Canary Islands, A Drag is Born has won five awards, including
      Best Solo Clown (NYC Fringe) and Best Solo Show (Orlando Fringe).

    copy_long: A female street clown accidentally becomes famous overnight at
      Chickadee TV Studios as Chickadee the Sexy Clown. Her childlike mission to
      bring joy and connection into a world of chaos is misunderstood. She is
      heartbroken to be valued through her sexual appeal rather than her art of
      clowning. A clash between pop culture and the art of clowning. Where does
      the need to bring joy come from? Why become a clown when you can have a
      serious job? What makes your heart ache? Dare to be a fool with Chickadee?

      A one-man (and one puppet) musical journey through a zombie outbreak,
      combining live performance, puppetry and animation. Ridiculous, dark,
      sometimes gruesome, warm, funny and sad. Can the undead feel? Can the
      living understand? Is there a way out of this nightmare? Will you be
      forced – ultimately – to sing? 'Absurd, eccentric, funny, full of pathos
      and unforced allegory', 'Probably the most bizarre, clever, hilarious and
      weirdly endearing thing I've ever seen on a stage' (Audience reviews).

      Berlin, 1933. Heinz goes out to the cinema and never comes home. London,
      2023. Clare claims the German citizenship her grandad Heinz gave up, but
      is it hers to take? 


      In the shadow of Brexit, Clare shines a light on her grandfather’s extraordinary true story - taking a journey from the cabaret scene of 1930s Berlin to becoming an 'enemy alien' in 1940s Britain, getting arrested by everyone from the Soviets to Winston Churchill along the way.


      A vivid account of one Jewish refugee trying to find his way home, and his granddaughter searching for her roots.

      followers. But when 15th-century mystic Margery of Kempe starts haunting
      her, Megan begins to wonder if she’s losing her grip – or if Margery is
      really there. As their connection grows unnervingly intense, Megan finds
      herself drawn to Margery in ways she can't explain, where devotion and
      desire bleed together. In this darkly funny comedy-drama, an internet
      "trad wife" influencer's carefully curated life unravels in an unexpected
      clash of past and present. Meg & Marge explores faith, feminism and the
      perils of performative perfection.

    copy_long: Country singer Marcy Aurora is out of prison after 20 years for
      murder, and she's ready for a comeback. In the studio recording a new
      album, she's pissed off and trying to find her voice again. Not taking any
      shit and singing her guts out, Marcy's going to find her way back no
      matter how much it hurts. A (nearly) solo show with live songs, it’s a
      raucous journey to Music City. Written and directed by Lee Papa, called "a
      tornado of a writer" by the New York Times, and starring Tennessee-born
      Biz Lyon.

    copy_long: Panoptikum amazes, entertains, and frightens. It has pace, humour and
      a strong theme with an emphasis on humanism. Thrilling, impressive dance
      which is an expression of total theatre, invites the spectator to a
      mystically decadent, visually compact freak show, over which the magical
      theatre dust of something ancient hovers. The world, inspired by the
      phenomenon of the nineteenth century, says a lot about our contemporary
      world. Panoptikum is about the fear of the stranger and the unknown, but
      also courage and hope. The multi award-winning dance theatre company
      returns to the Fringe! The Theatre Newspaper Award. Thalia Award Nominee.

      Sophie Anna Veelenturf explores what happens when political opposites

      experts. With humour and sharp dialogue, she delivers a bold, intimate
      dive into love and politics.

      Andy Warhol, after he refused to produce Up Your Ass. The directors got in

      only ones to get permission to perform the play."

      norm. Written and performed by Mimi Martin, she's bold, rebellious and
      impossible to resist. 'I can be the foreign devil if they want'.
