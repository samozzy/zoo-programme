      the form of three white guys named John filmmaker John Hughes, musician
      John Mayer and rock star Jon Bon Jovi. Which is sorta unexpected because
      she's an American Black woman from the South. But at major turning points
      in her life, when she is paralysed with fear, they appear, giving her
      inspiration and courage. A heartwarming, life-affirming mix of comedy and
      storytelling about three very unlikely guardian angels

      transformed into the Queen of the Carnival. With advanced age, abundant
      body hair and limited talents, he is an unlikely candidate. Praised as a

      clown, drag and queer joy reminds us it's never too late to embrace your
      true self. Created and performed by Edu Díaz, a Fulbright-awarded artist
      from the Canary Islands, A Drag is Born has won five awards, including
      Best Solo Clown (NYC Fringe) and Best Solo Show (Orlando Fringe).

    copy_long: Can (online) dating help bridge political divides? In Swiping Right,
      Sophie Anna Veelenturf explores what happens when political opposites
      connect. How do ideology and beliefs shape our desires and relationships?
      How do we navigate between attraction and resistance? Drawing on her own
      experience of doomed dates with conservative men, the self proclaimed
      'leftie' brings her personal quest to the stage. As Artist in Residence
      with renowned Belgian theatre company BERLIN, she blends stand-up,
      documentary theatre and re enacted interviews with dates, couples and
      experts. With humour and sharp dialogue, she delivers a bold, intimate
      dive into love and politics.

      dirt, a knife and real vegetables. We follow the life of Protagonist, a
      potato, observing its feelings and relationships in a world inhabited by
      other tubers, characters in a quirky and engaging narrative. We see
      Protagonist being born, falling in love, working: enormous steps,
      especially for a vegetable. A new immersive tabletop show by Batisfera,
      authors of the miniature epic drama The Gummy Bears' Great War, a moving

      performers dissolve. Eight-time Fringe First-winning theatre company
      Ontroerend Goed transforms traditional theatre into an experience that
      playfully shifts perspectives through video. Despite its interactive
      nature, you're free to simply observe as the performers navigate the
      space. This isn't about putting you on the spot – it's about recognising
      that without you, there is no theatre. Thanks for Being Here isn't just a
      show – it's a celebration of your presence. 'Radically hopeful' \*\*\*\*
