His girlfriend has left for Japan to disconnect from technology and live an older, simpler way of being. Dante is lost. Trapped in an unfulfilling job he hates, he embraces escapism by writing a film. As the screenplay emerges, we join a Spanish knight on a quest alongside his French squire, battling monsters and travelling epic landscapes. Gradually, Dante’s worlds begin to merge, overlap and intertwine around him.'

Follow veteran "star dresser" Pam as she works her magic through complex costume changes, confrontations, and quirky actor demands, all while staying hidden in the shadows. When the stress of invisibility gets heavy, supportive allies rally and equip her to stand up, curse like a sailor, and be seen. This may be a solo show, but Kimberly Prentice quick-changes her way through thirty plus distinct characters as we follow Pam’s hilarious, and sometimes harrowing, journey of working in the dark, unseen, while trying not to disappear.'

      copy_long: 'Inspired by encounters with people on the margins of society; a dissection of trauma and revival, pain and transformation. In a devotional setting of sinister rituals and acts of liberation, Madonna and Jesus appear as trash prophets. Surrounded by Paradise-Lost-iconography they deliver prayers for the outcasts and blessings for queer bodies. After their 2018 success with Baby Paradise, provocative German bambule.babys is returning to the Fringe with its new production. Alluding to feminist philosophy and politics of care, this is a piece dedicated to all those homesick for a better world.'

An expressionist and out gay man working in the studio system at the peak of Hollywood’s golden age, his moment in the movie-land spotlight lasted little more than 10 years. Just who was James Whale? This one-person show shines a light on his life and work, examining a sense of otherness and the outsider, and how his films still resonate, 90 years on.'

Even the chosen one needs a break sometimes, okay? But long soaks in the bath can lead to painful questions, and the cleaner Galahad gets, the dirtier he becomes. In this darkly comedic show about sex, jobs, and the Holy Grail, by the time Galahad gets out, he might not want to be so Pure anymore."

Obsessed characters discover and transform their space and themselves, transporting the spectator into a unique DIY experience.\n Sawdust Symphony is an intense dialogue between satisfaction, frustration and the smell of gasoline. Sawdust Symphony has been performed over 100 times across nine countries."
