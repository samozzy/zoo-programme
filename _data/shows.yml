    Come backstage at Double Bubble: The Musical, where things
    really aren't going to plan! The songs? Stolen. The lines?
    Forgotten. And every time someone says Macbeth, the set falls
    over. GOYA presents a musical catastrophe.
  copy_long: |-
    Come backstage for the world premiere of soon-to-be
    smash-hit Double Bubble: The Musical. That's right. It's
    Macbeth from the perspective of the three witches.
    Unfortunately, things aren't going to plan. The composers
    have stolen the songs, the performers have forgotten their
    lines and the technical team are technically incompetent. In
    under one hour, can this company ruin music and Macbeth
    for a generation? Join us as we crash through the canon of
    musical theatre and find out what happens when the
    hurlyburly's done. Under rehearsed, under slept and under
    extreme duress, GOYA presents a musical catastrophe.

    An electric power game between the patriarchy and a six-year-old
    girl in pink Crocs. Award-winning comedy about the infantilisation
    of women. There'll be jelly. And lots of it.
  copy_long: |-
    ‘You look 15, but I like that. I like women that look young’. An
    electric, one-woman comedy exploring sexualisation of
    young girls and infantilisation of women. A power game
    between the patriarchy and a six-year-old girl in pink Crocs.
    Pushing the boundaries of the male gaze, Naughty confronts
    the disturbing image of innocence and youth as sexy.
    Naughty is powered by the Pleasance Fringe Futures, won
    the Funniest Moment award at Oslo Fringe in 2021 (*****
    (Vilde Bodsberg, Journalist)) and was listed as 'unmissable'
    (ToDoList.org.uk). Praise for previous work: 'innovative and
    heartfelt' **** (Scotsman).

    What did the angel say? Could A G Rizzoli see the future?
    Travelling from the streets of LA to the coast of Suffolk,
    Dreamsick weaves a patchwork story of outsider art, California
    capitalism and the architecture of gender.
  copy_long: |-
    'I think I might be ill. Somewhere on the outside, on the
    tarmac and the paintwork.' An architect in San Francisco
    draws people as buildings, Elon Musk plans his colony on
    Mars and a woman, walking her dog, encounters an angel.
    With lyrical storytelling, fragile image-making and meticulous
    sound, Dreamsick is a nocturne of memories, dreams and
    visions by writer and composer Nat Norland. A solo
    performance about the losing of hope, the architecture of
    gender, the act of transformation, the construction of the
    future. 'Its ambition and confidence are genuinely
    remarkable' (DarkerNeon.blogspot.com for Portents).

    Seven-times Fringe First winner Ontroerend Goed is back with a
    new show. It starts when a person... Forget what you just read.
    Half a truth is often a great lie.
  copy_long: |-
    The show starts when a person comes on stage, walks to the
    microphone, talks. The person who is going to do all of this is
    good at opening scenes. If you open the show, you set the
    tone for the whole show. It's a big responsibility: if the first
    lines are well done, it's magic. The beginning can't go on
    forever. The rest of the show has to happen. Forget what you
    just read. Half a truth is often a great lie.

    Far Gone is a gut-kicking one-man performance about the
    transformation of a boy into a child soldier by Uganda's notorious
    LRA, told with humour, African storytelling and startling physical
    theatre.
  copy_long: |-
    A Roots Mbili Theatre and Sheffield Theatres co-production.
    'If I invited you to come with me on a journey, a story, will you
    come with me?' Northern Uganda. When Okumu's village is
    attacked by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), he and his
    brother's lives are changed forever. Far Gone is a profoundly
    moving story of a young boy's journey from childhood
    innocence to child soldier. Seen through the eyes of those
    that love him and those that betray him, Okumu's experience
    strikes straight at the heart through a powerful one-man
    performance.

    Saved is a multi-layered, retro-mechanical music show built
    around rescued 70s home organs. Turned inside out, their
    internal spinning speakers are exposed for us to see as well
    as hear. Along with cassettes, a turntable, AM radios and a
    modified whisk, Saved celebrates an analogue era where AB-C Fun Block and One Finger Chord buttons captivated our
    imagination. Leak, of Spaghetti Western Orchestra fame,
    gently transports us to a curious sound-world where the
    mundane becomes surprisingly beautiful. 'It knows exactly
    what it's doing and it does it sublimely' (Lyn
    Gardner, StagedoorApp.com)

    POV: you're a vlogger. A productive (but chill!) DIYing
    vlogger. It's the end of the world. What do you do when
    everyone's left the internet? This is a show with no words
    about being your best self when no one will watch. Jessica
    Bickel-Barlow and Offie-nominated theatre company Part of
    the Main deliver a surprising, tension-filled peek into the offcamera life of an influencer who has no idea you are
    watching her. 'The clever ideas are a confrontation to the
    audience' (TheatreWeekly.com).

    What. The. Frick? It's 2010 and we're on the Year Six Isle of
    Wight trip. Last week, Sammy put a note in Toby's locker
    pretending to be her best friend Lucy. We aren't quite sure
    why. This is a play about sleep, guilt and the worlds in our
    heads. And Tom Daley. As If is an emerging company
    making theatre with and about imagination. Lucid was
    selected for, and performed at, the National Student Drama

    Join Stuart on the opening night of his doomed biographical play.

    'Hilarious', 'Mesmerising' and 'Outstanding' (London Pub Theatres ****)
    This comedic one-man
    show introduces Stuart Bagcliffe, who is about to perform his
    autobiographical play to an audience for the first time. Ill prepared and lacking experience, Stuart is naturally a bundle
    of nerves. Join him as he attempts to make it through the
    play in one piece, contending with his overbearing mother
    watching from the wings and a sound technician who's half
    asleep, as well as his own demons and insecurities. What
    could possibly go wrong?

    Sometimes hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking, Manic is a solo
    show that combines spoken word, puppetry and theatre, exploring
    what it means to have lots and lots of bad sex.
  copy_long: |-
    When Raina arrives at her spoken word gig to see her exes
    in the audience, all the questions she's had about her past
    sexual experiences begin to surface. Through poetry,
    comedy and one very awkward encounter with a cheese
    string, she begins to explore questions about bad sex, drunk
    sex and the grey areas of consent. Sometimes hilarious,
    sometimes heartbreaking, Manic is a solo show that
    combines poetry, puppetry and theatre to ask whether it is
    possible to say you were violated without implicating a
    partner. Development of this show has been supported by
    Arts Council England.

    Humanity has both a morbid curiosity and an instinctual
    repulsion when it comes to death. Over the next 50 minutes
    we'll find out which is stronger. Although it's something we'll
    all go through, death is one of the least understood parts of
    the human experience, so Chronic Insanity is diving into the
    deep end. 52 Souls is an open and fun examination of death
    and our reactions to this terrifying inevitability. Using a pack
    of cards, the audience randomly generates a performance to
    understand humanity's obsession with – and ignorance about
    – death.
