    Groundbreaking adaptation, by award-winning neurodivergent
    playwright Nicola Werenowska, focusing on the three Polish
    women at the centre of this rich work. Interweaving narration,
    dialogue, lyrical text and movement.
  copy_long: |-
    Originally published in 1915, The Rainbow was
    extraordinarily ahead of its time as Lawrence explores the
    experiences of three generations of Polish women living in
    Nottinghamshire at the turn of the 20th century. This
    groundbreaking adaptation, by award-winning
    neurodivergent playwright Nicola Werenowska, will focus on
    the women at the centre of this rich work. Through
    interweaving narration, dialogue, lyrical text and movement,
    this work creates a space for matrilineal knowledge, and a
    debate around decolonising narratives by addressing the
    women's Polish heritage.

    This devised performance questions our motivations and choices
    within a capitalist system – deeply rooted in historic colonial
    infrastructures and thinking patterns – in which "advanced"
    societies conduct their lifestyle around the suffering of others.
  copy_long: |-
    Developed around the ancient tradition of a Tea Ceremony, a
    male geisha (award-winning actor Marios Ioannou) begins to
    question her role as "servant" and "entertainer" operating in a
    system based on capital, consummation and ownership. As
    an icon of beauty, well-trained to seduce her customers
    through movement, song and dance, the Geisha leads the
    audience on a journey of modern-day abuse, child labour,
    human trafficking, torture and slavery, and the high price we
    pay for our joy and greed.

    Marriage in Progress playfully sends up lifelong commitment while celebrating it – and critiques the vanity of performance while revelling in it.
    Lauren Katz (Curb Your Enthusiasm) and Joey Slotnick (The
    Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, The Good Wife) explore marriage as
    improvisation and improvisation as marriage. The Chicago
    Tribune called ED Ensemble's 'wonderfully energetic and
    self-effacing style' an 'adventurous and delightful experience'
    and a 'hilariously engaging' and 'surreal success.' They
    emerged in Chicago as one of the most innovative
    companies in North America.

    A poetic, subtle and witty dance performance on
    conventions, expectations and perception. As in an audio
    guide, or a fake indoctrination machine, every audience
    member is presented with individual text through
    headphones – hanging from the ceiling. The project seeks to
    emphasize the notion of being singular/plural through an
    interpassive system of textual, auditive and bodily movement
    material. As in a simulator of the imaginary, three dancers
    take your metaphorical hand and guide you through your
    own imagination.

    ‘I'm still waiting for my child... Every man I meet, I think
    maybe that’s my son’. A documentary protest performance,
    based on a true story, gives stage to voiceless mothers. The
    show examines the experience of oppressed childbirth and
    exposes a dark affair from the 1950s about the kidnapping of
    immigrant children, whose fate is still unknown. Maternity
    searches for an emotional connection between those
    mothers and women from all over the world. Founded by
    Hana Vazana Gruwald, Frechot Ensemble is a collective of
    women creators dealing with issues of ethnicity, feminism
    and activism.

    Brothers tells the story of two estranged brothers Matt and
    Jay, in their early 30s, who re-unite as one fights testicular
    cancer and the other battles addiction. Fearful for their
    survival, Matt and Jay revisit their dysfunctional childhood
    and the night that impacted their once unbreakable
    relationship. Brothers is a heart-wrenching, laugh-out-loud
    rollercoaster of an international premiere, featuring Daniel
    O'Kane and Liam O'Kane, who are actually brothers. Written
    by Kerry Drumm, Brothers is a play that explores grief, fear
    and love, and questions if keeping secrets in a bid to protect
    can do more harm than good.

    'You must suffer me to go my own dark way...' Stevenson's
    classic science-horror is reborn, with award-winning

    (CNS Theatre Awards). Sell-out show: Dundee Fringe, 2021.

    Blood Red Lines is co-created with victims and survivors of acts
    of violence perpetrated on the Irish border. A shattering piece of
    verbatim theatre that tells a different story. Directed by Robert
    Rae.
  copy_long: |-
    Blood Red Lines was developed with and performed by
    victims and survivors of the tragedies of South Armagh,
    border counties and Dublin in the darkest days of the Irish
    Conflict. It received standing ovations when it toured Ireland
    pre-pandemic. The result of a six-month residency in Newry
    supported by The Playhouse Theatre (Derry), BAFTAwinning director Robert Rae collaborated with those worst
    affected by the conflict, including the Dublin and Dundalk
    bombings, to develop this extraordinary and shattering piece
    of verbatim theatre. With new songs from the legendary folk
    singer and peace activist Tommy Sands.

    befriends an invisible man named Griffin, bringing him fame
    and fortune, love and violence. Akimbo present this violent,
    beautiful and comic story through an innovative creative
    language that blends storytelling and physical theatre with
    martial arts, puppetry and movement.

    Award-winning political theatre about the harmless, loser boxer Rocky, who against all odds defeats his own inferiority and unreasonable loser life. He has all the wrong opinions, though fortunately no airtime. But what
    happens when he breaks character and gains power? Rocky!
    is fiercely entertaining and will swipe you off your feet. 'Left
    me speechless and with a hammering heart' ★★★★★
    (Scenekanten.com). 'This experience proved to me that
    theatre is able to deal with the most problematic discussions
    of zeitgeist and power' ★★★★★ (Berlingske).

    Part of #DANISH showcase at Edinburgh Fringe 2022.

    Kat is a woman (for quite a while now). She is a migrant (since 1999) from the Thracian Valley in Bulgaria. In 2022 (in April, surrounded by family and friends), she turned forty. To celebrate and mark this moment she gave herself the permission to do the one thing she had always wanted- to make a dance solo. Kat has always danced, but she has never before been a dancer. But then, she’s never been 40 before either.
    This is the result of 40 years of joy and hardship, laughter and tears, super tunes and super moves.

    We all have a mother, and an opinion about how she should
    be. Can a mother be allowed to be temperamental,
    impulsive, senseless, flaky, and still a mother, and a good
    one? A bitingly funny and honest portrayal of a mother's life.
    A story of a volatile overachiever who is in constant
    competition with time and is not above flinging a burger on a
    wall. The show fearlessly challenges myths of motherhood
    and aims to shake them up. Here, she is simply a human
    being who just happens to be a mother, too.

    A grenade hits Joe in WW1. He wakes up in the hospital without
    his limbs, eyes, ears and mouth. Joe fought for liberty and
    democracy and lost everything. Now he reaches out to tell his
    story.

    A grenade hits Joe Bonham in WW1. He wakes up in the
    hospital to discover his arms, legs, eyes, ears and mouth are
    gone. Left is but a torso – the living dead alone with his
    thoughts. Now he breaks through to be heard. In the
    performance, Joe spins the audience through his tragedy
    and the 1900s: the century of growth, violence and loss. And
    he takes no easy way out. Joe fought in the name of liberty,
    democracy and his native land to lose everything. Now he
    questions what he's been taught to dream of.

    You will never cross the street in the same way again! Don
    Gnu digs into the tediousness of everyday routines in search
    of poetry and humour with muscular physicality and edgy
    stunt tricks. One ordinary day, four ordinary men take an
    ordinary walk through the city, until one of them suddenly
    decides to rebel... With trademark Don Gnu everyday stunts
    and raw physicality, Walk-Man is a performance about the
    extraordinary experiences of ordinary life. In a world where
    our everyday rules, norms and routines no longer apply –
    who are we really?

    Come backstage at Double Bubble: The Musical, where things
    really aren't going to plan! The songs? Stolen. The lines?
    Forgotten. And every time someone says Macbeth, the set falls
    over. GOYA presents a musical catastrophe.
  copy_long: |-
    Come backstage for the world premiere of soon-to-be
    smash-hit Double Bubble: The Musical. That's right. It's
    Macbeth from the perspective of the three witches.
    Unfortunately, things aren't going to plan. The composers
    have stolen the songs, the performers have forgotten their
    lines and the technical team are technically incompetent. In
    under one hour, can this company ruin music and Macbeth
    for a generation? Join us as we crash through the canon of
    musical theatre and find out what happens when the
    hurlyburly's done. Under rehearsed, under slept and under
    extreme duress, GOYA presents a musical catastrophe.

    Pat and Pete live happily in their tiny botanic bathroom, so
    happily they don't remember any ambitions they've had in
    life... until the day Mr Citrus Man, a life guru from the Big
    City, moves into the rest of their home. A strange letter and a
    forgotten dream suddenly leads Pat on a dangerous journey,

    Man is a philosophical tragicomedy about love and ambition
    that combines thigh-slapping humour with life's big

  copy_long: |-
    ‘You look 15, but I like that. I like women that look young’. An
    electric, one-woman comedy exploring sexualisation of
    young girls and infantilisation of women. A power game
    between the patriarchy and a six-year-old girl in pink Crocs.
    Pushing the boundaries of the male gaze, Naughty confronts
    the disturbing image of innocence and youth as sexy.
    Naughty is powered by the Pleasance Fringe Futures, won
    the Funniest Moment award at Oslo Fringe in 2021 (★★★★★
    (Vilde Bodsberg, Journalist)) and was listed as 'unmissable'
    (ToDoList.org.uk). Praise for previous work: 'innovative and

    What did the angel say? Could A G Rizzoli see the future?
    Travelling from the streets of LA to the coast of Suffolk,
    Dreamsick weaves a patchwork story of outsider art, California
    capitalism and the architecture of gender.
  copy_long: |-
    'I think I might be ill. Somewhere on the outside, on the
    tarmac and the paintwork.' An architect in San Francisco
    draws people as buildings, Elon Musk plans his colony on
    Mars and a woman, walking her dog, encounters an angel.
    With lyrical storytelling, fragile image-making and meticulous
    sound, Dreamsick is a nocturne of memories, dreams and
    visions by writer and composer Nat Norland. A solo
    performance about the losing of hope, the architecture of
    gender, the act of transformation, the construction of the
    future. 'Its ambition and confidence are genuinely
    remarkable' (DarkerNeon.blogspot.com for Portents).

    Unwanted Objects is the new story and song show from
    critically acclaimed duo David Head and Matt Glover. They
    invite you to explore a mysterious second-hand shop full of
    old teddy bears, abandoned chess sets and ships in bottles.
    Combining bittersweet short stories, full of wit, whimsy and
    warmth, with folk, pop and blues inspired musical
    melancholia, it explores sentimentality, our possessions and
    the meaning we attach to them. 'Stunning' ★★★★★

    Seven-times Fringe First winner Ontroerend Goed is back with a
    new show. It starts when a person... Forget what you just read.
    Half a truth is often a great lie.
  copy_long: |-
    The show starts when a person comes on stage, walks to the
    microphone, talks. The person who is going to do all of this is
    good at opening scenes. If you open the show, you set the
    tone for the whole show. It's a big responsibility: if the first
    lines are well done, it's magic. The beginning can't go on
    forever. The rest of the show has to happen. Forget what you
    just read. Half a truth is often a great lie.

    recent disappearance
  copy_long: "Naomi has issues. Bad ones. The worst, actually…  She was raised by
    a M.I.L.F. (Mother She’d Like to Fuck). \n\nHave You Seen This Woman? is a new
    black comedy about the scariest thing on earth: Hot Moms. Imagine if Ottessa Moshfegh
    and Duncan MacMillan wrote Rosemary’s Baby. Spooky right?\n\nJessie-Ann Kohlman
    makes her Fringe debut with a play fresh from its sold out premiere in New York

    Far Gone is a gut-kicking one-man performance about the
    transformation of a boy into a child soldier by Uganda's notorious
    LRA, told with humour, African storytelling and startling physical
    theatre.
  copy_long: |-
    A Roots Mbili Theatre and Sheffield Theatres co-production.
    'If I invited you to come with me on a journey, a story, will you
    come with me?' Northern Uganda. When Okumu's village is
    attacked by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), he and his
    brother's lives are changed forever. Far Gone is a profoundly
    moving story of a young boy's journey from childhood
    innocence to child soldier. Seen through the eyes of those
    that love him and those that betray him, Okumu's experience
    strikes straight at the heart through a powerful one-man
    performance.

    'Hilarious', 'Mesmerising' and 'Outstanding' (London Pub Theatres ★★★★)
    This comedic one-man
    show introduces Stuart Bagcliffe, who is about to perform his
    autobiographical play to an audience for the first time. Ill prepared and lacking experience, Stuart is naturally a bundle
    of nerves. Join him as he attempts to make it through the
    play in one piece, contending with his overbearing mother
    watching from the wings and a sound technician who's half
    asleep, as well as his own demons and insecurities. What
    could possibly go wrong?

    Sometimes hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking, Manic is a solo
    show that combines spoken word, puppetry and theatre, exploring
    what it means to have lots and lots of bad sex.
  copy_long: |-
    Winner of Best Solo Show at Fuse International 2022

    When Raina arrives at her spoken word gig to see her exes in the audience, all the questions she's had about her past sexual experiences begin to surface. Through poetry, comedy and one very awkward encounter with a cheese string, she begins to explore questions about bad sex, drunk sex and the grey areas of consent. Sometimes hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking, Manic is a solo show that combines poetry, puppetry and theatre to ask whether it is possible to say you were violated without implicating a partner.

    An open and fun examination of death and our reactions to this
    terrifying inevitability. Using a pack of cards, the audience
    randomly generates a performance to understand humanity's
    obsession with – and ignorance about – death.
  copy_long: |-
    Humanity has both a morbid curiosity and an instinctual
    repulsion when it comes to death. Over the next 50 minutes
    we'll find out which is stronger. Although it's something we'll
    all go through, death is one of the least understood parts of
    the human experience, so Chronic Insanity is diving into the
    deep end. 52 Souls is an open and fun examination of death
    and our reactions to this terrifying inevitability. Using a pack
    of cards, the audience randomly generates a performance to
    understand humanity's obsession with – and ignorance about
    – death.
