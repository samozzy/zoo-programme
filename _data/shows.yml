    Conflict. It received standing ovations when it toured Ireland
    pre-pandemic. The result of a six-month residency in Newry

    affected by the conflict, including the Dublin and Dundalk
    bombings, to develop this extraordinary and shattering piece
    of verbatim theatre. With new songs from the legendary folk
    singer and peace activist Tommy Sands.

    Award-winning contemporary circus company returns with an
    extraordinary show looking at the hectic pace of today’s
    world. In a unique set design featuring a giant treadmill, four
    performers and two musicians mix dance, running, cyr-wheel
    acrobatics and original live music, while running almost a
    whole marathon. This UK debut for Runners marks the
    company’s fourth Edinburgh appearance following sell-out
    seasons in 2011, 2015 and 2017. Best Czech Theatre 2020
    and 2021 (Theatre Critics Awards). Total Theatre Award
    nominee. ‘No wonder this low-fi, anarchic circus have been
    hoovering up awards wherever they stumble’ (Scotland on
    Sunday).

    Award-winning political theatre based on the movie about the
    harmless, loser boxer Rocky, who against all odds defeats
    his own inferiority and unreasonable loser life. He has all the
    wrong opinions, though fortunately no airtime. But what
    happens when he breaks character and gains power? Rocky!
    is fiercely entertaining and will swipe you off your feet. 'Left
    me speechless and with a hammering heart' ★★★★★
    (Scenekanten.com). 'This experience proved to me that
    theatre is able to deal with the most problematic discussions
    of zeitgeist and power' ★★★★★ (Berlingske).

    A story of a volatile overachiever who is in constant
    competition with time and is not above flinging a burger on a

    and aims to shake them up. Here, she is simply a human

    and the 1900s: the century of growth, violence and loss. And
    he takes no easy way out. Joe fought in the name of liberty,
    democracy and his native land to lose everything. Now he

    Naughty is powered by the Pleasance Fringe Futures, won
    the Funniest Moment award at Oslo Fringe in 2021 (*****

    What did the angel say? Could A G Rizzoli see the future?
    Travelling from the streets of LA to the coast of Suffolk,
    Dreamsick weaves a patchwork story of outsider art, California
    capitalism and the architecture of gender.
  copy_long: |-
    'I think I might be ill. Somewhere on the outside, on the
    tarmac and the paintwork.' An architect in San Francisco
    draws people as buildings, Elon Musk plans his colony on
    Mars and a woman, walking her dog, encounters an angel.
    With lyrical storytelling, fragile image-making and meticulous
    sound, Dreamsick is a nocturne of memories, dreams and
    visions by writer and composer Nat Norland. A solo
    performance about the losing of hope, the architecture of
    gender, the act of transformation, the construction of the
    future. 'Its ambition and confidence are genuinely
    remarkable' (DarkerNeon.blogspot.com for Portents).

  copy_short: Unwanted Objects is the new story and song show from critically acclaimed
    duo David Head and Matt Glover. Funny, bittersweet short stories and folk-inspired
    melancholia about teddy bears, chess sets and sentimentality. ***** “Stunning”
    – EdFringe Review.
  copy_long: |-
    Unwanted Objects is the new story and song show from
    critically acclaimed duo David Head and Matt Glover. They
    invite you to explore a mysterious second-hand shop full of
    old teddy bears, abandoned chess sets and ships in bottles.
    Combining bittersweet short stories, full of wit, whimsy and
    warmth, with folk, pop and blues inspired musical
    melancholia, it explores sentimentality, our possessions and
    the meaning we attach to them. 'Stunning' *****

    Seven-times Fringe First winner Ontroerend Goed is back with a
    new show. It starts when a person... Forget what you just read.
    Half a truth is often a great lie.
  copy_long: |-
    The show starts when a person comes on stage, walks to the
    microphone, talks. The person who is going to do all of this is
    good at opening scenes. If you open the show, you set the
    tone for the whole show. It's a big responsibility: if the first
    lines are well done, it's magic. The beginning can't go on
    forever. The rest of the show has to happen. Forget what you
    just read. Half a truth is often a great lie.

    Far Gone is a gut-kicking one-man performance about the
    transformation of a boy into a child soldier by Uganda's notorious
    LRA, told with humour, African storytelling and startling physical
    theatre.
  copy_long: |-
    A Roots Mbili Theatre and Sheffield Theatres co-production.
    'If I invited you to come with me on a journey, a story, will you
    come with me?' Northern Uganda. When Okumu's village is
    attacked by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), he and his
    brother's lives are changed forever. Far Gone is a profoundly
    moving story of a young boy's journey from childhood
    innocence to child soldier. Seen through the eyes of those
    that love him and those that betray him, Okumu's experience
    strikes straight at the heart through a powerful one-man
    performance.

    What. The. Frick? It's 2010 and we're on the Year Six Isle of
    Wight trip. Last week, Sammy put a note in Toby's locker
    pretending to be her best friend Lucy. We aren't quite sure
    why. This is a play about sleep, guilt and the worlds in our
    heads. And Tom Daley. As If is an emerging company
    making theatre with and about imagination. Lucid was
    selected for, and performed at, the National Student Drama
    Festival, 2022.

    Join Stuart on the opening night of his doomed biographical play.
    Mum's in the wing, the technician is fast asleep and Stuart has no
    idea what he's doing. What could possibly go wrong?

    'Hilarious', 'Mesmerising' and 'Outstanding' (London Pub Theatres ****)
    This comedic one-man
    show introduces Stuart Bagcliffe, who is about to perform his
    autobiographical play to an audience for the first time. Ill prepared and lacking experience, Stuart is naturally a bundle
    of nerves. Join him as he attempts to make it through the
    play in one piece, contending with his overbearing mother
    watching from the wings and a sound technician who's half
    asleep, as well as his own demons and insecurities. What
    could possibly go wrong?

    Sometimes hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking, Manic is a solo
    show that combines spoken word, puppetry and theatre, exploring
    what it means to have lots and lots of bad sex.
  copy_long: |-
    When Raina arrives at her spoken word gig to see her exes
    in the audience, all the questions she's had about her past
    sexual experiences begin to surface. Through poetry,
    comedy and one very awkward encounter with a cheese
    string, she begins to explore questions about bad sex, drunk
    sex and the grey areas of consent. Sometimes hilarious,
    sometimes heartbreaking, Manic is a solo show that
    combines poetry, puppetry and theatre to ask whether it is
    possible to say you were violated without implicating a
    partner. Development of this show has been supported by
    Arts Council England.

    An open and fun examination of death and our reactions to this
    terrifying inevitability. Using a pack of cards, the audience
    randomly generates a performance to understand humanity's
    obsession with – and ignorance about – death.
  copy_long: |-
    Humanity has both a morbid curiosity and an instinctual
    repulsion when it comes to death. Over the next 50 minutes
    we'll find out which is stronger. Although it's something we'll
    all go through, death is one of the least understood parts of
    the human experience, so Chronic Insanity is diving into the
    deep end. 52 Souls is an open and fun examination of death
    and our reactions to this terrifying inevitability. Using a pack
    of cards, the audience randomly generates a performance to
    understand humanity's obsession with – and ignorance about
    – death.
