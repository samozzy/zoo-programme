<p class="helper-text">We strongly encourage pre-purchasing tickets from the booking page or EdFest.com ahead of your arrival at ZOO. In line with the Fringe Society's move to e-tickets, we are not operating paper tickets this year. By pre-booking, you will help speed up waiting and admission times once the doors are open. Doors typically open 5 minutes before the advertised start time.</p>
