<b>HOW TO: AIONOS ONLINE</b> <br>

If you have purchased your ticket for an online showing (Livestream or VR), you will be given access to Toasterlab's Discord server where you will find support from the Aionos team to make sure you have the best experience. They are a small company located primarily in Toronto, Canada, so they suggest logging onto the server as soon as you can, and appreciate your patience with their replies due to availability and time differences.<br>
Please read below for instructions on how to join in with Aionos online.<br>

<b>The Livestream</b> <br>
●	The livestream of the show is an interactive experience within Discord. You must join the server to be able to access this version of the show. <br>
●	Your ticket for the show stream provides you with access to the Discord and the streaming version of the show for the run of the show. If you would like to see it again, you’re welcome to join the stream for any performance!<br>
●	If you’re having issues, we’ve got folks available to help you optimize your experience. Please find our support channels on discord and ask away, we’ll work to respond as soon as possible and will be available before and after every show. <br>

<b>The VR Experience</b><br>
●	To view the VR experience from your home, you will need your own Meta Quest 2. If you’re in Edinburgh or Toronto, we may be able to help arrange one for you to use too (limited to one per location per performance). If interested, purchase your online ticket and message us on the discord to begin to arrange use of a provided headset. <br>
●	You will need to download the free <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2305425142915253/">Flipside Studio App</a> (link: <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2305425142915253/">https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2305425142915253/</a>) from the Meta Quest Store. The VR experience cannot be accessed without this. Please download it as soon as you book your tickets, and at least 24 hours before chosen showtime to complete the tutorial, get used to the controls, and seek support on the Discord server: <a href="https://discord.gg/aionos">https://discord.gg/aionos</a><br>
●	Please log on to Flipside at least 15 minutes in advance of the showtime to allow yourself to be guided by our expert staff for a smooth introduction to the experience. <br>
●	The Virtual Reality experience of Aionos is an experimental way to participate in the show. There may be glitches! If you experience technical difficulties, we will be available for support on the Discord server by text and voice, offer our Livestream as an alternative way to view the show, and will work with you to find an alternative date to support getting you into the VR experience. <br>

<b>The In-Person (IRL) Show</b><br>
●	If you see the show <a href="https://zoofestival.co.uk/programme/aionos/">in person</a>, you’re also welcome to join the Aionos Discord community to discuss the show and view the streaming version. <br>
